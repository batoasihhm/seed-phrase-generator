## 🚀 Overview

**Wallet-Gen** is a powerful tool to create cryptocurrency wallets, including Bitcoin and EVM-based wallets like Ethereum, BNB, and MATIC. It can also help recover forgotten wallets that may hold a balance.

Built in C++, Wallet-Gen is open-source. This means anyone can access and modify the code. It is faster than many Python-based wallet generators, primarily because it utilizes your graphics card for better performance. 

For EVM wallets, Wallet-Gen uses the keccak256 algorithm. Bitcoin wallets are created using the Segwit format under Bech32.

- Generate a single EVM wallet (ETH, BNB, MATIC).
- Search for Bitcoin wallets containing a balance.
- Discover forgotten wallets.
- Supports high-speed generation based on your hardware.
- Open-source code available for modification. 

## 📦 System Requirements
